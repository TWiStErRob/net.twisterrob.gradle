        summary="Missing density folder"
        explanation="Icons will look best if a custom version is provided for each of the major screen density classes (low, medium, high, extra-high, extra-extra-high). This lint check identifies folders which are missing, such as `drawable-hdpi`.&#xA;&#xA;Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true`. For more information on current density usage, see https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards"

    <issue
        id="Autofill"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Missing `autofillHints` attribute"
        category="Usability"
        priority="3"
        summary="Use Autofill"
        explanation="Specify an `autofillHints` attribute when targeting SDK version 26 or higher or explicitly specify that the view is not important for autofill. Your app can help an autofill service classify the data correctly by providing the meaning of each view that could be autofillable, such as views representing usernames, passwords, credit card fields, email addresses, etc.&#xA;&#xA;The hints can have any value, but it is recommended to use predefined values like &apos;username&apos; for a username or &apos;creditCardNumber&apos; for a credit card number. For a list of all predefined autofill hint constants, see the `AUTOFILL_HINT_` constants in the `View` reference at https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html.&#xA;&#xA;You can mark a view unimportant for autofill by specifying an `importantForAutofill` attribute on that view or a parent view. See https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setImportantForAutofill(int)."
