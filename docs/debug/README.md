The projects in this folder are meant to be used as debugging tools. If a unit tests fails the files from there can be copied over to the corresponding version and the project can remote debug itself. Open the folder in IDEA as a Gradle project and attach sources from the corresponding wrapper, then place breakpoint and debug away with `-Dorg.gradle.debug=true`.
