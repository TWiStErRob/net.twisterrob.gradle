# How to upgrade AGP in the project?

 1. Update compile AGP version:
    * `libs.versions.toml`: change `agp` and `lint` to the latest stable.
    * Run `gradlew jar` to make things compile.
    * Change `net.twisterrob.test.android.pluginVersion` to the same as `agp`.
 2. Update AGP compat versions
    * Change all `android-gradle-v__x` to the latest patch version.
    * If there's a new alpha/beta/rc/stable release, create a new module: `:compat:agp-__x`.  
      This will be empty, but will allow immediate browsing of source code.
 3. Add compatibility checks via `AGPVersions` if necessary.
    * Review `AGPVersionsTest` to bump latest classpath version.
    * Review `AGPVersionsTest` if there's a new constant.
 4. Add new CI matrix based on AGP compatibility guide.
    * For example if AGP 7.2.1 requires Gradle 7.3.1 and latest stable is 7.4.2, create the following combinations:
      ```yaml
      - name: "AGP 7.2.x on Gradle 7.3+"
      - name: "AGP 7.2.x on Gradle 7.3+ - plugin"
      - name: "AGP 7.2.x on Gradle 7.x"
      - name: "AGP 7.2.x on Gradle 7.x - plugin"
      ```
      Comment out the 7.x version if there's no newer stable yet.
    * After pushing CI changes:
       * Add conversation to add new CI jobs to branch protection rules just before merging.
 5. Update `README.md` table and surrounding text.
 6. Review this document if something was missing.
